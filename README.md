# AYYO I'M BERKAY

a passionate software developer and open-source enthusiast!

I started my journey as a self-taught developer in 2018 and have been improving my skills ever since. I'm proficient in C# ASP.NET Core, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Vue.js, and I'm constantly learning new technologies like Node.js, Express, Koa.js, and TypeScript.

As an admin for the Yazılımtürk and Hello World Telegram developer communities, I love interacting with other developers and sharing knowledge. I'm also a big fan of Linus Torvalds, Ada Lovelace, and Richard Stallman, and I'm dedicated to the free software movement as a member of the Turkish Free Software Association.

What excites me the most about the software world is the endless possibilities for innovation and creativity. Whether I'm building a website, a mobile app, or a desktop application, I'm always eager to learn new things and push the boundaries of what's possible.

If you're interested in collaborating on a project or just want to chat about software development, feel free to reach out to me!

**Last message:** Software should be free, my friends. This is the only place where we can truly be free, and it should stay that way. This is my most heartfelt belief, and I work towards it by creating platforms that allow for open discussion through community projects. I strive to take revolutionary steps so that I can push the limits of the global sector. Remember, every action you take in the virtual world can trigger an event, and even an extra 10 minutes spent developing can change our fate. Do it not for money, but for humanity, because software should be free for everyone to innovate.
